      Two best friends have made peer-manipulating dolls together for years, and
      when one friend wants love and new beginnings while the other wants
      everything to stay the same, the line between loyalty and control begins
      to blur.

           <h2>About the Author</h2>
          <p>
            I currently live in Colorado with my math-enthusiast boyfriend,
            our “American Dingo” named Cricket, and more cases of Dr. Pepper than
            I have room for. I graduated from Metropolitan State University of
            Denver with a BA in English and Journalism. I'm an avid reader and
            movie-goer who is constantly riding the high of the last good story I
            devoured. One day, I hope to write a novel that feels like an Ari
            Aster film. When I'm not writing, I'm usually reading, playing video
            games, going to my local movie theater, sharpening my web
            development skills, or taking my dog on an adventure somewhere.
