    I am seeking representation for <strong>RESIN</strong>, a standalone young
    adult urban fantasy novel with sequel potential at 82,000 words, with
    difficult girls doing wicked things, similarly found in <strong>LITTLE
    MONSTERS</strong> by Kara Thomas and <strong>THE MERCILESS</strong> by
    Danielle Vega, and a love story like the romance in
    <strong>STARFISH</strong> by Akemi Dawn Bowman.

    In a former pawn shop, Abbie and her cousin, Laura, craft handmade dolls
    that manipulate the personalities of the people they know. Abbie can only
    make dolls while Laura also works the magic behind them.
    <br />
    <br />
    It starts with Cole, who watches Abbie and makes her feel as if he knows her
    secrets. Then, it happens to Cassie, the best friend of the girl Laura
    repeatedly bullies. After her, it’s Justin, the boy who struggles to tell
    Abbie how he feels, who meets her eyes in the halls and makes her wish for
    something more too.
    <br />
    <br />
    Laura expects Abbie to sneer at his affections, so Abbie keeps her own
    feelings a secret. A doll can’t change anyone unless it’s finished, and she
    doesn’t plan on finishing Justin’s. As Laura pushes Abbie to work faster,
    their friendship fractures. For the first time, Abbie steps out from her
    cousin's shadow to decide for herself what she wants and welcomes Justin
    into her life instead.
    <br />
    <br />
    Soon, Abbie spends less time in the doll shop and more nights with him as
    she grows apart from her cousin and the routine of her usual life. Laura
    becomes possessive, desperate, and selfish as she tries to keep her
    influence over Abbie. Laura won’t share the spotlight, and when expected to,
    she works to destroy everything that Abbie loves. To push back, Abbie
    further unravels Laura’s control, string by string. She stops making dolls,
    and she breaks ones that already exist, and to break a doll is to take away
    its power.
    <br />
    <br />
    Abbie never wanted to lose her best friend, but she confronts the reality
    that Laura might not be the person she thought she knew. She must choose
    between Laura or the new life she’s creating without her before her world is
    damaged beyond repair.

    My name is Randi Muilenburg, and I currently live in Colorado with my
    math-enthusiast boyfriend, our eight-month-old puppy named Cricket, and more
    cases of Dr. Pepper than I have room for. I graduated from Metropolitan
    State University of Denver in December 2016 with a BA in English and
    Journalism.

    Thank you so much for your time and consideration.
