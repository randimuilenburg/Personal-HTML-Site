    I am seeking representation for <strong>THE SHAPES THE SHADOWS MAKE</strong>
    , a standalone young adult urban fantasy novel with sequel potential at
    90,000 words. It has relentless monsters like <em>It Follows</em> and the
    looming dread of <strong>THE DEVOURING GRAY</strong> by Christine Lynn
    Herman.
    <br />
    <br />
    Seventeen-year-old Lainie doesn’t have a shadow like everyone else. Instead,
    she has “Dakota,” the shadow-like monster that’s visible only to her. Lainie
    has no idea why Dakota is by her side and stopped even questioning it long
    ago. That is, until she sees other shadows following her home the night she
    breaks up with her boyfriend. Then, she meets Hayden.
    <br />
    <br />
    Hayden, the boy with messy black hair, tired eyes, and his own shadow-like
    monster at his heels, just transferred to Lainie’s high school at the worst
    possible time. Students are dying left and right in bizarre accidents, and
    the hallways feel like a graveyard, scattered with flowers and memorials.
    Lainie’s never met anyone with a shadow like hers, but Hayden doesn’t want
    to talk. He just wants to pretend his life is normal, even if that means
    forever living in fear of the monster behind him, while also starting over
    at a new school and trying to force his heart to let go of the boy he loved.
    <br />
    <br />
    Soon, Lainie finds herself hunted by shadows, like Dakota but feral. Their
    numbers begin to grow, and the only thing she knows is that they mean her
    harm if she doesn’t fight back.
    <br />
    <br />
    Lainie only wanted to get over her breakup and move on with her life, but
    her life just got a lot more complicated. With the reluctant help of Hayden,
    who is just as hunted by shadows as she is, they work together to survive.
    The deaths of their classmates weren’t accidents, and, Lainie realizes, she
    and Hayden are next unless they can find a way to save themselves.

    My name is Randi Muilenburg, and I currently live in Colorado with my
    math-enthusiast boyfriend, our “American Dingo” named Cricket, and more
    cases of Dr. Pepper than I realistically have room for. I graduated from
    Metropolitan State University of Denver with a BA in English and Journalism.
    When I'm not writing, I'm usually reading, playing video games, going to my
    local movie theater, sharpening my web development skills, or taking my dog
    on an adventure somewhere.

    Thank you so much for your time and consideration.
